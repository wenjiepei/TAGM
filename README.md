This is the implementation of the Temporal Attention-Gated Model, which is proposed in the following paper:
Wenjie Pei, Tadas Baltrušaitis, David M.J. Tax and Louis-Philippe Morency. "Temporal Attention-Gated Model for Robust Sequence Classification", https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00385.pdf.

The code will be released soon.
